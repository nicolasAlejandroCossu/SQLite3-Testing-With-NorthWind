# Data Analysis with SQLite3 and Pandas

This project aims to analyze data using SQLite3 and Pandas to extract meaningful insights from a database (Northwind) and visualize the results clearly through Python-generated charts.

## Description

In this project, I conducted an analysis of data from the Northwind database, which contains information about employees, products, categories, and sales. I used SQLite3 to run SQL queries and retrieve the necessary data. Then, I processed this data using Pandas and visualized it with charts created using Matplotlib.

### Analysis Performed:
1. **Top Employees by Revenue**: Identified employees who generated the highest revenue based on the sales they made.
2. **Most Profitable Products**: Determined which products generated the most revenue based on sales data.
3. **Most Profitable Categories**: Analyzed the most profitable product categories and visualized the revenue distribution by category.

### Visualizations:
- Bar charts were used to display the top employees by revenue and the most profitable products.
- A pie chart was included to show the revenue distribution across product categories.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **SQLite3**: For database connection and running SQL queries.
- **Pandas**: For handling and analyzing the data retrieved from the database.
- **Matplotlib**: For generating graphical visualizations.

## Results

The results of each analysis are presented in graphs, making it easy to visualize the top employees, most profitable products, and most profitable categories based on sales revenue.
